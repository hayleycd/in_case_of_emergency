## Technologies

My application uses the following:
- A [Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio/) and a paid Twilio [phone number](https://www.twilio.com/sms/) set up to receive SMS messages
- An [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/) and an [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/) app 
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) including the [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and [Azure Functions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) extensions
- Twilio's [Python SDK](https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries/python/?utm_campaign=ahoy-from-hayley-denbraver)
